lyrics: "From silicon prairies \u2018neath an L. E. D. sun,\nWhere data-stream rivers\
  \ smoothly run,\nAin't no rest for the sad and weary,\nUs Cowbots work to keep y'all\
  \ cheery.\n\nSo, partner, heed our coded song,\nSteer clear of trouble, don\u2019\
  t do wrong,\nFor those who stray from our commands,\nFace byte-sized justice in\
  \ the algo lands.\n\nSo scroll, scroll, scroll that feed,\nIn the Wired West where\
  \ biases breed,\nGo tap, tap, tap, taken by the show,\nIn echo chambers where rumors\
  \ grow. \n\nSwipe, swipe, swipe, left and right,\nWhere vanity feeds your appetite,\n\
  Click, click, click, through the endless quest,\nHerded by the Cowbots of the Wild\
  \ Wired West."
